# Semester 2.5

I have worked on ***IoT*** and ***Big Data Technologies*** module in this semester (January 2023 ~ February 2023). 

In the IoT module, I designed and proposed an IoT system with my project group members to address the waste disposal problem that is a concern due to the overpopulation of the world, and 
in the Big Data Technologies module, I learned about systems for processing big data, focusing on services such as Hadoop and Spark deployed by Apache Corporation.

> We have worked on three projects in IoT modules. The first project `Assignment 1 - Group 1.pdf` mainly focus on raising problem of waste management and 
> the second project `Assignment 2 - Group 1.pdf` focuses more on the system technology explanations. Third project `Assignment 3 - Group 3.pdf` is the manuscript
> of our IoT systems based on assignment 1 and 2. IoT system which we have designed and proposed are distributed in three main features, ***devices(sensors)***, 
> ***Cloud(Backend)*** and ***Frontend***. I have taken part of cloud system design, researched a system for communication between devices such as sensors and 
> cloud services, as well as how to mine and store massive amounts of data, and how to transmit it to the front-end.

> There were two projects in Big Data Technologies module. The first one is individual assignment that I have worked on data analysis individually with Hadoop, and
> second project is the group assignment to mine and analyze data, build and apply a prediction model for anticipation. I used specific linux commands operations
> and Java programs for MapReduce to process big data from the beginning until my data produces a meaningful business case using proper Big Data tools and applications. 
> In group assignment, it is similar that we have processed big data to produce meaningful information, but instead of Java and Linux, Python3 was used for the
> analysis and execution.
