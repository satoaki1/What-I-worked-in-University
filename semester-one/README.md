# Semester 1
Semester 1 was the first semester in my school life. During this period, I have learnt:
* [**Computer Architecture and Organizations**](#computer-architecture-and-organizations)
* [**Object-Oriented Programming with Java**](#object-oriented-programming-with-java)
* [**Database Systems**](#database-systems)
* [**Discrete Structures**](#discrete-structures)

and experienced noteworthy projects in those modules.
<br/>
<br/>

> ### **Computer Architecture and Organizations**
>
> I have learned the main components of the computer architecture and organization, logic circuit's logics or other calculations related to the computer operation. The report of group assignment involves the studies of Raspberry Pi, Computer Memory Hierarchy, and logic circuit's logic computations. 
> 
> I have mainly contributed to the answers of Part C, which involves the questions of asking logic circuits for this work. Based on the provided specific logic equations, I have created a table to indicate the patterns, constructed valid circuit and optimized the equations.

<br/>

> ### **Object-Oriented Programming with Java**
> 
> The project of building apps contribute to the climate change issue was assessed to us, me and other classmates. In our group, we have built the app that involves 5 functions: **warning**, **climate information**, **Alerting system**, **How to escape** and **Information to prepare for the climate issues**. Detailed information is provided in the [OOP](https://github.com/satoaki1/OOP-Application-Project) pages.

> ### **Database Systems**
>
> We were required to create databases suitable for the provided business case and perform a couple of operations based on the database systems we have created. 
> 
> For this project, I have created those databases and documented detailed information about them, solved some questions and performed operations to solve the problems.  

<br/>

> ### **Discrete Structures**
>
> The group in this module required us to prepare the case study to apply the discrete mathematics' knowledges we have learned in the module. Our group has decided to apply the knowledges of probability and determined the case study of some board games played in the casinos, calculate the probability to win the game. We have constructed tree diagrams for the explanations and documented the diagram, too.
